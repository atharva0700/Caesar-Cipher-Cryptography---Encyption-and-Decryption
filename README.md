# Caesar-Cipher-Cryptography---Encyption-and-Decryption
The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet to create the ciphertext. This shift value serves as the key for both encryption and decryption. While it's straightforward to implement, Caesar Cipher is not secure for sensitive communications due to its susceptibility to brute-force attacks. Despite its simplicity, it serves as an educational tool for understanding basic cryptographic principles and algorithms.
